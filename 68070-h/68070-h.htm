<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>We have gathered together to-day to
pay our meed of respect and affection to
the memory of William McKinley, who
as President won a place in the hearts of
the American people such as but three or
four of all the Presidents of this country
have ever won. He was of singular uprightness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
and purity of character, alike in
public and in private life; a citizen who
loved peace, he did his duty faithfully and
well for four years of war when the honor
of the nation called him to arms. As
Congressman, as governor of his State,
and finally as President, he rose to the
foremost place among our statesmen,
reaching a position which would satisfy
the keenest ambition; but he never lost
that simple and thoughtful kindness toward
every human being, great or small, lofty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
or humble, with whom he was brought in
contact, which so endeared him to our
people. He had to grapple with more
serious and complex problems than any
President since Lincoln, and yet, while
meeting every demand of statesmanship,
he continued to live a beautiful and touching
family life, a life very healthy for this
nation to see in its foremost citizen; and
now the woman who walked in the
shadow ever after his death, the wife to
whom his loss was a calamity more crushing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
than it could be to any other human
being, lies beside him here in the same
sepulcher.</p>
</div>

<p>There is a singular appropriateness in
the inscription on his monument. Mr.
Cortelyou, whose relations with him were
of such close intimacy, gives me the following
information about it: On the
President’s trip to the Pacific slope in the
spring of 1901 President Wheeler, of the
University of California, conferred the
degree of LL. D. upon him in words so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
well chosen that they struck the fastidious
taste of John Hay, then Secretary of State,
who wrote and asked for a copy of them
from President Wheeler. On the receipt
of this copy he sent the following letter to
President McKinley, a letter which now
seems filled with a strange and unconscious
prescience:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. President</span>:</p>

<p>President Wheeler sent me the inclosed
at my request. You will have the
words in more permanent shape. They
seem to me remarkably well chosen, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
stately and dignified enough to serve—long
hence, please God—as your epitaph.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours, faithfully,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Hay</span>.</p>


<p class="p2 noic">“<span class="smcap">University of California</span>,</p>

<p class="right">“<i>Office of the President</i>.</p>

<p>“By authority vested in me by the regents
of the University of California, I
confer the degree of Doctor of Laws upon
William McKinley, President of the United
States, a statesman singularly gifted to
unite the discordant forces of the Government
and mold the diverse purposes of
men toward progressive and salutary
action, a magistrate whose poise of judgment
has been tested and vindicated in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
succession of national emergencies; good
citizen, brave soldier, wise executive,
helper and leader of men, exemplar to his
people of the virtues that build and conserve
the state, society, and the home.</p>

<p>“Berkeley, May 15, 1901.”</p>
</div>

<p>It would be hard to imagine an
epitaph which a good citizen would be
more anxious to deserve or one which
would more happily describe the qualities
of that great and good citizen whose life
we here commemorate. He possessed to
a very extraordinary degree the gift of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
uniting discordant forces and securing
from them a harmonious action which
told for good government. From purposes
not merely diverse, but bitterly
conflicting, he was able to secure healthful
action for the good of the State. In
both poise and judgment he rose level to
the several emergencies he had to meet
as leader of the nation, and like all men
with the root of true greatness in them
he grew to steadily larger stature under
the stress of heavy responsibilities. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
was a good citizen and a brave soldier, a
Chief Executive whose wisdom entitled
him to the trust which he received
throughout the nation. He was not only
a leader of men but preeminently a
helper of men; for one of his most
marked traits was the intensely human
quality of his wide and deep sympathy.
Finally, he not merely preached, he was,
that most valuable of all citizens in a
democracy like ours, a man who in the
highest place served as an unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
example to his people of the virtues that
build and conserve alike our public life,
and the foundation of all public life, the
intimate life of the home.</p>

<p>Many lessons are taught us by his
career, but none more valuable than the
lesson of broad human sympathy for and
among all of our citizens of all classes and
creeds. No other President has ever more
deserved to have his life work characterized
in Lincoln’s words as being carried
on “with malice toward none, with charity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
toward all.” As a boy he worked hard
with his hands; he entered the Army as a
private soldier; he knew poverty; he
earned his own livelihood; and by his
own exertions he finally rose to the position
of a man of moderate means. Not
merely was he in personal touch with
farmer and town dweller, with capitalist
and wageworker, but he felt an intimate
understanding of each, and therefore an
intimate sympathy with each; and his consistent
effort was to try to judge all by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the same standard and to treat all with
the same justice. Arrogance toward the
weak, and envious hatred of those well
off, were equally abhorrent to his just and
gentle soul.</p>

<p>Surely this attitude of his should be
the attitude of all our people to-day. It
would be a cruel disaster to this country
to permit ourselves to adopt an attitude of
hatred and envy toward success worthily
won, toward wealth honestly acquired.
Let us in this respect profit by the example<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
of the republics of this Western Hemisphere
to the south of us. Some of these
republics have prospered greatly; but
there are certain ones that have lagged
far behind, that still continue in a condition
of material poverty, of social and
political unrest and confusion. Without
exception the republics of the former class
are those in which honest industry has
been assured of reward and protection;
those where a cordial welcome has been
extended to the kind of enterprise which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
benefits the whole country, while incidentally,
as is right and proper, giving
substantial rewards to those who manifest
it. On the other hand, the poor and
backward republics, the republics in which
the lot of the average citizen is least desirable,
and the lot of the laboring man
worst of all, are precisely those republics
in which industry has been killed because
wealth exposed its owner to spoliation.
To these communities foreign capital now
rarely comes, because it has been found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
that as soon as capital is employed so as
to give substantial remuneration to those
supplying it, it excites ignorant envy and
hostility, which result in such oppressive
action, within or without the law, as sooner
or later to work a virtual confiscation.
Every manifestation of feeling of this kind
in our civilization should be crushed at
the outset by the weight of a sensible
public opinion.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of our material
prosperity there is only one other thing as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
important as the discouragement of a spirit
of envy and hostility toward honest business
men, toward honest men of means;
this is the discouragement of dishonest
business men.</p>

<p>Wait a moment; I don’t want you to
applaud this part unless you are willing
to applaud also the part I read first, to
which you listened in silence. I want
you to understand that I will stand just as
straight for the rights of the honest man
who wins his fortune by honest methods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
as I will stand against the dishonest man
who wins a fortune by dishonest methods.
And I challenge the right to your support
in one attitude just as much as in the
other. I am glad you applauded when
you did, but I want you to go back now
and applaud the other statement. I will
read a little of it over again. “Every
manifestation of ignorant envy and hostility
toward honest men who acquire
wealth by honest means should be crushed
at the outset by the weight of a sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
public opinion.” Thank you. Now I’ll
go on.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of our material
prosperity there is only one other thing as
important as the discouragement of a
spirit of envy and hostility toward honest
business men, toward honest men of
means, and that is the discouragement of
dishonest business men, the war upon the
chicanery and wrongdoing which are peculiarly
repulsive, peculiarly noxious when
exhibited by men who have no excuse of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
want, of poverty, of ignorance for their
crimes. My friends, I will wage war
against those dishonest men to the utmost
extent of my ability, and I will stand no
less stoutly in defense of honest men, rich
or poor. Men of means and, above all,
men of great wealth can exist in safety
under the peaceful protection of the state
only in orderly societies, where liberty
manifests itself through and under the
law. That is what you fought for, you
veterans. You fought for the supremacy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of the national law in every corner of this
Republic. It is these men, the men
of wealth, who more than any others,
should in the interest of the class to
which they belong, in the interest of
their children and their children’s children,
seek in every way, but especially
in the conduct of their lives, to insist upon
and to build up respect for the law. It is
an extraordinary thing, a very extraordinary
thing, that it should be necessary for
me to utter as simple a truth as that; yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
it is necessary. It may not be true from
the standpoint of some particular individual
of this class of very wealthy men, but
in the long run it is preeminently true
from the standpoint of the class as a whole,
no less than of the country as a whole,
that it is a veritable calamity to achieve a
temporary triumph by violation or evasion
of the law, and we are the best friends of
the man of property, we show ourselves
the staunchest upholders of the rights of
property when we set our faces like flint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
against those offenders who do wrong in
order to acquire great wealth, or who use
this wealth as a help to wrongdoing.</p>

<p>I sometimes feel that I have trenched
a little on your province, Brother Bristol,
and on that of your brethren, by preaching.
But whenever I speak of the wrongdoing
of a man of wealth or of a man of
poverty, poor man or rich man, I always
want to try to couple together the fact that
wrongdoing is wrong just as much in one
case as in the other, with the fact that right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
is just as much right in one case as in the
other. I want the plain people of this
country, I want all of us who do not have
great wealth, to remember that in our
own interest, and because it is right, we
must be just as scrupulous in doing justice
to the man of great wealth as in exacting
justice from him.</p>

<p>Wrongdoing is confined to no class.
Good and evil are to be found among
both rich and poor, and in drawing the
line among our fellows we must draw it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
on conduct and not on worldly possessions.
Woe to this country if we ever get
to judging men by anything save their
worth as men, without regard to their
fortune in life. In other words, my plea
is that you draw the line on conduct and
not on worldly possessions. In the abstract
most of us will admit this. It is a
rather more difficult proposition in the
concrete. We can act upon such doctrines
only if we really have knowledge of,
and sympathy with, one another. If both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the wage-worker and the capitalist are able
to enter each into the other’s life, to meet
him so as to get into genuine sympathy
with him, most of the misunderstanding
between them will disappear and its
place will be taken by a judgment
broader, juster, more kindly, and more
generous; for each will find in the other the
same essential human attributes that exist
in himself. It was President McKinley’s
peculiar glory that in actual practice he
realized this as it is given to but few men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to realize it; that his broad and deep sympathies
made him feel a genuine sense of
oneness with all his fellow-Americans,
whatever their station or work in life, so
that to his soul they were all joined with
him in a great brotherly democracy of the
spirit. It is not given to many of us in
our lives actually to realize this attitude
to the extent that he did; but we can at
least have it before us as the goal of
our endeavor, and by so doing we
shall pay honor better than in any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
way to the memory of the dead President
whose services in life we this day
commemorate.</p>
